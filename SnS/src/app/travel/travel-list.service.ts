And an amazing underwater world! Filipinos are very friendly and always willing to help. The Philippines is best destination for longer holidays.",

Just imagine these enormous animals flying few meters above your head! Huarascan National Park in Cordiliera Blanca offers amazing views! Huarascan, the highest peruvian mountain (6768m) with huge, beautiful valley underneath. It comes out of the clouds just for few seconds before they come to cover it's summit again. Famous Machu Picchu? Views were amazing, but... Huge queue in front of the gates at 4 o'clock in the morning, amount of people walking on the old buildings, trained llamas forced to stay laying for the photos... Not our thing.",

Did you know the point on the earth that's closest to the Moon? No, it's not Mount Everest. It is the mount Chimborazo in Ecuador!

Almost 50 years have passed since the end of the war, but its effects are still clearly visible. The attitude of the Vietnamese towards tourists may explain their recent history.
