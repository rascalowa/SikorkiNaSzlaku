It is a set of 275 minor waterfalls, on the highest point water comes down from 82 meters. Whole Iguazu waterfall is 2 kilometers wide! Just imagine this big mass of water (1700mÂ³) falling down every second... That view is worth every penny!",

Siargao island offers great waves for surfing and wonderful landscapes both on the coast and inland. Wonderful surf atmosphere, people with passion and parties with live music are just an addition. Filipinos are very friendly and always willing to help. The Philippines is best destination for longer holidays, espesially for water lovers: there is an amazing underwater world!",

Huge space between steep sides is a great place for biggest flying birds in the world. Condors weight up to 15 kg and their wingspan could be even 320cm! Just imagine these enormous animals flying few meters above your head! Huarascan National Park in Cordiliera Blanca also offers amazing views. Huarascan, the highest peruvian mountain (6768m) with huge, beautiful valley underneath. It comes out of the clouds just for few seconds before it's summit get cover again. Famous Machu Picchu? Views were amazing, but... Huge queue in front of the gates at 4 o'clock in the morning, amount of people walking on the old buildings, trained llamas forced to stay laying for the photos...

We climbed up the flowery meadow, watch the city from above and went down among needle-like rock formations without meeting anyone along the way. But the best bolivian trip was 3 days later! Salar de Uyuni is the world's largest salt flat (over 10,000 square kilometers). During dry season we can see hexagonal salt formations on the surface. After rain Uyuni transforms into the world's biggest mirror. Unforgettable view...",

Ingredients may vary between cities and restaurants, but it is always huge portion of food! But Colombians have much more: street orange juice, empanadas, corn soup, avocados in size of melon... Columbia is worth to visit not only for food. City of Medellin with it's great vibes, Valle de Cocora with the world's tallest palm trees or colorful Guatape city should be also on your list!",

Most of these outfits gave off an intense smell of herbs or stable animals, which we did not like so much especially when sharing bus on winding mountain roads... But the Ecuadorian views made up for everything! Did you know the point on the earth that's closest to the Moon? No, it's not Mount Everest. It is the mount Chimborazo in Ecuador! It is not the highest mountain, but it is so close to the equaitor that it's summit is the farthest point from the Earth's center. ",

The greatlimestone formations in Ha Long Bay, Tam Coc province with it's lush green rice terraces, mysterious ruins of old temples in Hoi An... But not everything in Vietnam was so wonderful. Almost 50 years have passed since the end of the war, but the effects are still clearly visible. The Vietnamese have not always been warm and friendly, but their recent history may explain this behavior. Labirynths of tiny tunnels show how they lived during war. The brutal traps, terrible weapons and it's horrible effect everybody can see in War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh.",
